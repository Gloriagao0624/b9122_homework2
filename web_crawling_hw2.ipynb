      "according to the sec’s complaint, filed on april 18, 2022, passos, concerned about the significant decline in irb’s stock price following a short seller’s report questioning irb’s financial results, fabricated and then spread a story in february 2020 that berkshire hathaway inc. had recently invested in irb. the complaint further alleges that passos created and shared with others a fake shareholder list that showed berkshire had made substantial purchases of irb stock. passos also allegedly communicated the false information to analysts and investors during meetings in both the united kingdom and the u.s. according to the complaint, irb’s stock price rose by more than 6 percent during the 24 hours following the brazilian and u.s. media reports that berkshire had invested in irb and subsequently dropped by more than 40 percent after berkshire denied a week later that it was an investor.\n",
      "“as alleged in the complaint, passos engaged in a brazen scheme to defraud investors and went to great lengths to perpetuate his scheme, including doctoring a shareholder list,” said jason j. burt, associate director of enforcement in the denver regional office. “we will continue to pursue bad actors, whether located in the u.s. or abroad, whose fraudulent conduct impacts u.s. investors.”\n",
      "the sec’s complaint, filed in u.s. district court for the southern district of new york, alleges violations of the antifraud provisions of the exchange act and seeks civil money penalties and an officer and director bar. in a parallel action, the department of justice today announced criminal charges against passos.\n",
      "the sec’s investigation, which is continuing, was conducted by jeffrey lyons and supervised by ian karpel and jason burt of the denver regional office. the litigation against passos is being led by zachary carlyle and gregory kasper. \n",

      "the sec’s order finds that, in the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2017, rollins, a nationwide provider of pest control services, made unsupported reductions to their accounting reserves in amounts sufficient to allow the company to round up reported eps to the next penny. according to the order, the company’s then cfo, paul edward northen, directed the improper accounting adjustments without conducting an analysis of the appropriate accounting criteria under generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and without adequately memorializing the basis for those accounting entries. the order also finds that rollins made other accounting entries that were not supported by adequate documentation in multiple additional quarters from 2016 through 2018.\n",
      "\"this is the fourth action and the highest penalty to date against an issuer in connection with the division of enforcement’s highly successful and continuing eps initiative, which uses data analytics to uncover hard-to-detect accounting and disclosure violations by public companies,\" said gurbir s. grewal, director of the sec’s division of enforcement. \"the sec staff’s ever-increasing sophistication with data made today’s action possible and underscores that we will continue to pursue public companies that lack adequate accounting controls and engage in improper earnings management practices.\"\n",
      "the sec’s order finds that rollins and northen violated sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the securities act of 1933 and that rollins violated the financial reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the securities exchange act of 1934. the order also finds that northen violated section 13(b)(5) and rule 13b2-1 of the exchange act and further caused rollins’ violations of the financial reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the exchange act. without admitting or denying the sec’s findings, rollins and northen have agreed to cease and desist from future violations of the charged provisions and pay civil penalties of $8 million and $100,000, respectively.\n",
      "the sec’s investigation was conducted by carolyn winters and tonya tullis, with assistance from james connor of the trial unit and alex lefferts of the office of investigative and market analytics, and was supervised by carolyn welshhans, fuad rana, and kristen dieter.\n",

      "the sec’s order finds that stericycle, a leading provider of medical waste and other services in 16 countries worldwide, paid millions of dollars in bribes to obtain and maintain business from government customers in brazil, mexico, and argentina from at least 2012 to 2016. according to the sec’s order, stericycle staff kept and emailed spreadsheets that identified government customers who received bribes. the bribes were referred to with code names, including “alfa” – short for alfajores, a sweet cookie popular in argentina. the scheme also included sham third-party vendors who used false invoices to conceal cash payments to government clients. stericycle also failed to have sufficient internal accounting controls in place, such as a centralized compliance department, to prevent or even detect the misconduct, and failed to implement its fcpa policies or procedures prior to 2016.\n",
      "“stericycle rapidly expanded in latin america without any meaningful oversight or compliance measures, as evidenced by widespread bribery schemes lasting for many years in most of its latin america operations,” said eric i. bustillo, director of the sec’s miami regional office. “companies in pursuit of global expansion cannot disregard the need for appropriate controls.”\n",
      "stericycle consented to the sec’s cease-and-desist order that it violated the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the fcpa, and agreed to pay approximately $28.2 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. the sec’s order provides for an offset of up to approximately $4.2 million of any disgorgement paid to brazilian authorities. therefore, the company's minimum payment to the sec would be approximately $24 million. stericycle must also retain an independent corporate monitor for two years followed by one year of self-reporting.\n",
      "the sec’s investigation was conducted by jeffrey cook and christine lynch with assistance from lina fernandez and andrew schiff, and supervised by eric busto, jessica weissman, and glenn gordon. the sec appreciates the assistance of the department of justice criminal division’s fraud section, the federal bureau of investigation, and the controladoria-geral da união/advocacia-geral da união and the ministério público federal in brazil.\n",

      "text here: the securities and exchange commission today charged sung kook (bill) hwang, the owner of family office archegos capital management, lp (archegos), with orchestrating a fraudulent scheme that resulted in billions of dollars in losses. the sec also charged archegos’s chief financial officer, patrick halligan; head trader, william tomita; and chief risk officer, scott becker for their roles in the fraudulent scheme.\n",
      "the sec’s complaint alleges that, from at least march 2020 to march 2021, hwang purchased on margin billions of dollars of total return swaps. these security-based swaps allow investors to take on huge positions in equity securities of companies by posting limited funds up front. as alleged, hwang frequently entered into certain of these swaps without any economic purpose other than to artificially and dramatically drive up the prices of the various companies’ securities, which induced other investors to purchase those securities at inflated prices. as a result of hwang’s trading, archegos allegedly underwent a period of rapid growth, increasing in value from approximately $1.5 billion with $10 billion in exposure in march 2020 to a value of more than $36 billion with $160 billion in exposure at its peak in march 2021.\n",
      "the complaint also alleges that, as part of the scheme, archegos repeatedly and deliberately misled many of archegos’s counterparties about archegos’s exposure, concentration and liquidity, in order to get increased trading capacity so that archegos could continue buying swaps in its most concentrated positions, thereby driving up the price of those stocks.  ultimately in march 2021, price declines in archegos’s most concentrated positions allegedly triggered significant margin calls that archegos was unable to meet, and archegos’s subsequent default and collapse resulted in billions of dollars in credit losses among archegos’s counterparties.\n",
      "\"today, we charged archegos capital management and affiliated individuals with committing fraud and manipulating stock prices using total return swaps. the collapse of archegos last spring demonstrated how activities by one firm can have far-reaching implications for investors and market participants. i thank the sec staff for taking swift action to hold these actors responsible for their alleged misconduct, which hurt investors across our capital markets,\" said sec chair gary gensler. \"the failure of archegos underscores the importance of our ongoing work to update the security-based swaps market to enhance the investor protections, integrity, and transparency of this market. further, i encourage prime brokers and other market participants to remain vigilant to the risks presented by counterparty relationships.\"\n",
      "\"we allege that hwang and archegos propped up a $36 billion house of cards by engaging in a constant cycle of manipulative trading, lying to banks to obtain additional capacity, and then using that capacity to engage in still more manipulative trading,\" said gurbir s. grewal, director of the sec’s division of enforcement. \"but the house of cards could only be sustained if that cycle of deceptive trading, lies and buying power continued uninterrupted, and once archegos’s buying power was exhausted and stock prices fell, the entire structure collapsed, allegedly leaving archegos’s counterparties billions in trading losses.\"\n",
      "the sec’s complaint, filed in federal district court in manhattan, charges hwang and the other defendants with violating antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. the complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. the sec also seeks to bar individual defendants from serving as a public company officer and director.\n",

      "according to the sec’s complaint, beginning in 2016, vale manipulated multiple dam safety audits; obtained numerous fraudulent stability certificates; and regularly misled local governments, communities, and investors about the safety of the brumadinho dam through its environmental, social, and governance (esg) disclosures. the sec’s complaint also alleges that, for years, vale knew that the brumadinho dam, which was built to contain potentially toxic byproducts from mining operations, did not meet internationally-recognized standards for dam safety. however, vale’s public sustainability reports and other public filings fraudulently assured investors that the company adhered to the “strictest international practices” in evaluating dam safety and that 100 percent of its dams were certified to be in stable condition.\n",
      "\"many investors rely on esg disclosures like those contained in vale’s annual sustainability reports and other public filings to make informed investment decisions,\" said gurbir s. grewal, director of the sec’s division of enforcement. \"by allegedly manipulating those disclosures, vale compounded the social and environmental harm caused by the brumadinho dam’s tragic collapse and undermined investors’ ability to evaluate the risks posed by vale’s securities.\"\n",

      "according to the sec’s order, since at least august 2016, in multiple public filings, including bond offering materials, medley overstated its assets under management by including “committed capital” amounts from non-discretionary clients, whose agreements with medley imposed no obligation to invest with medley and whose investing activity through medley was minimal. the taubes and medley did not disclose that there was a risk that a significant amount of the clients’ capital would never be invested and would therefore never generate the fee income on which medley’s financial growth depended. the order additionally finds that in june 2018 the taubes used positive projections of medley’s likely future growth, for which they had no reasonable basis, to recommend to advisory clients a merger whereby medley’s two business development company clients would acquire medley and give the taubes contracts for high-paying jobs. the order finds that the materially misleading projections were incorporated into calculations of the “expected” benefit included in the proxy materials that encouraged investors to vote in favor of the transaction.\n",
      "“under the federal securities laws, investors are entitled to complete and accurate information about the companies they invest in,” said lara shalov mehraban, acting director of the sec’s new york regional office. “the taubes, as the ceos of a publicly-traded asset manager, failed to ensure that investors were given correct information about the company’s assets under management and adequate disclosures about its risks.”\n",

      "the sec’s order finds that, during consecutive quarters in nvidia’s fiscal year 2018, the company failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant element of its material revenue growth from the sale of its graphics processing units (gpus) designed and marketed for gaming. cryptomining is the process of obtaining crypto rewards in exchange for verifying crypto transactions on distributed ledgers. as demand for and interest in crypto rose in 2017, nvidia customers increasingly used its gaming gpus for cryptomining.\n",
      "in two of its forms 10-q for its fiscal year 2018, nvidia reported material growth in revenue within its gaming business. nvidia had information, however, that this increase in gaming sales was driven in significant part by cryptomining. despite this, nvidia did not disclose in its forms 10-q, as it was required to do, these significant earnings and cash flow fluctuations related to a volatile business for investors to ascertain the likelihood that past performance was indicative of future performance. the sec’s order also finds that nvidia’s omissions of material information about the growth of its gaming business were misleading given that nvidia did make statements about how other parts of the company’s business were driven by demand for crypto, creating the impression that the company’s gaming business was not significantly affected by cryptomining.\n",
      "“nvidia’s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company’s business in a key market,” said kristina littman, chief of the sec enforcement division’s crypto assets and cyber unit. “all issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.”\n",

      "in late january 2021, many brokers restricted investors’ ability to purchase a group of highly volatile stocks generally known as “meme stocks.” according to the sec’s order, on january 28, 2021, tradezero was instructed by its clearing broker not to allow its customers to purchase three meme stocks. tradezero ultimately halted purchases for about 10 minutes. after the halt, tradezero and pipitone made misleading public statements via interviews, social media, and in a press release in an effort to distinguish their company from brokers that restricted trading during that period. for example, in a reddit “ask me anything,” pipitone said, “that some trading firms are blocking these symbols is disgusting, unprecedented… our clearing firm tried to make us block you and we refused.”\n",

      "according to the sec’s order, riversource offered and sold variable annuities to retail investors through an affiliated broker-dealer/investment adviser, ameriprise financial services, llc. the order finds that certain employees of riversource developed and implemented a sales practice that caused exchange offers to be made to holders of variable annuities to switch from one variable annuity to another which had the effect of increasing sales commissions for riversource employees, while also increasing riversource’s variable annuity related revenues. according to the order, these types of transactions increased significantly from 2016 until 2018 when riversource’s compliance department put a stop to the sales practice abuses.\n",

      "the sec alleges that schessel and scworx issued this press release despite having neither a legitimate supplier of covid-19 test kits nor an executed purchase agreement with a buyer. the complaint further alleges that schessel and scworx publicly repeated the false and misleading statements about the distribution of covid-19 rapid test kits over the course of april 2020.\n",
      "at the time, the sec ordered that trading be suspended temporarily in the securities of scworx between april 21, 2020, and may 5, 2020, because of questions and concerns regarding the adequacy and accuracy of publicly available information in the marketplace concerning scworx.\n",

      "according to the sec’s order, the resolution with tenaris is the result of an alleged bribe scheme involving agents and employees of its brazilian subsidiary to obtain and retain business from the brazil state-owned entity petrobras. specifically, the order finds that between 2008 and 2013, approximately $10.4 million in bribes was paid to a brazilian government official in connection with the bidding process at petrobras. the bribes were funded on behalf of tenaris’ brazilian subsidiary by companies affiliated with tenaris’ controlling shareholder.\n",

      "the sec filed a complaint in federal district court in manhattan against former cfo karen rosenberger and former controller joanna lanni. among other things, the sec’s complaint alleges that rosenberger engaged in fraud through her role in improperly recognizing revenue on multiple transactions and that she also misled synchronoss’s auditor about multiple transactions. the sec alleges lanni was involved in improper accounting for one transaction.\n",
      "“investors are entitled to rely on financial statements that are free of accounting improprieties, and when an issuer and its executives and employees engage in accounting gimmicks, we will use every available tool, including significant corporate penalties and individual accountability, to address such misconduct,” said gurbir s. grewal, director of the sec’s division of enforcement. “today’s action should also put public company executives on notice that even when they are not charged with having a role in the misconduct at issue, we will still pursue clawbacks of compensation under sox 304 to ensure they do not financially benefit from their company’s improper accounting.”\n",

      "as alleged in the various charging documents filed today, synchronoss’s improper accounting primarily concerned three categories of transactions: (1) transactions for which there was not persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) acquisitions/divestitures in which synchronoss recognized revenue on license agreements rather than netting those purported amounts against the purchase prices; and (3) license/hosting transactions, in which it improperly recognized revenue upfront, instead of ratably over the term of the multi-year arrangement. in addition, the sec alleged that certain synchronoss employees entered into “side letter” arrangements, concealing facts indicating that the revenue that synchronoss recognized upfront was in fact contingent on future events. the impact of the improper accounting was material and in many instances allowed the company to meet earnings targets.\n",

      "according to the sec’s order, cohnreznick improperly accepted sequential’s conclusion that its goodwill, an accounting term for the excess amount paid to acquire a company over its book value, was not impaired or reduced in value, in the third quarter of 2017. despite cohnreznick’s national office partners and the firm’s own valuation specialists expressing concerns with sequential’s conclusion, the firm failed to obtain sufficient evidence or conduct additional procedures. the order finds that cohnreznick’s deficient system of quality control led to failures to adhere to professional auditing standards. as to the longfin audit, the order finds that cohnreznick and its national office failed to address known issues involving related party transactions, which were used by longfin to fraudulently inflate its revenues.\n",
      "a second related order finds that on multiple occasions from year-end 2016 through the second quarter of 2017, wyss accepted sequential management’s assertions that goodwill was not impaired despite strong indicators of impairment. the order also finds that in the third quarter of 2017, wyss, jackson, and hilbert were confronted with indications that sequential’s goodwill impairment test was not supported by sufficient evidence, but they still accepted sequential’s conclusion that goodwill was not impaired even though appropriate additional audit procedures had not been performed.\n",

      "according to the sec’s order, from march 2015 through november 2018, schwab’s mandated disclosures for its robo-adviser product, schwab intelligent portfolios, stated that the amount of cash in the robo-adviser portfolios was determined through a “disciplined portfolio construction methodology,” and that the robo-adviser would seek “optimal return[s].” in reality, schwab’s own data showed that under most market conditions, the cash in the portfolios would cause clients to make less money even while taking on the same amount of risk. schwab advertised the robo-adviser as having neither advisory nor hidden fees, but didn’t tell clients about this cash drag on their investment.\n",
