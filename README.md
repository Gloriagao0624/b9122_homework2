The repository contains two files, one for webcrawler code that we covered in class and one for webcrawler code for hw2.

web_crawling_hw2.ipynb: This notebook contains two questions. 
1) Crawl pages whose seed url is the press releases page of the Federal Reserve System:
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm and collect pages that contain the word “covid” found within the page. The goal is to collect at least 10 such urls. At the end of the crawling the code should output the urls of the webpages found to contain the word “covid”. 
2) Crawl pages whose seed url is the press releases page of the Securities and Exchange Commission: https://www.sec.gov/news/pressreleases and collect urls of press releases that contain the word “charges”. The code should output the first 20 such links that it finds. For each link output the url and the text. 

webcrawler.py: codes that we covered in the class.
